Welcome to SHADY-STACK
======================

What Is SHADY-STACK?
```````````````````

As the name implies, this is a less than kosher web stack based of of the SWAG
stack. I developed it for my projects as I am in university and web hosting can
be expensive. The shady stack consists of the following:  

1. A **S** tatic site hosted (GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, ECT.) 
2. Simplistic pages that communicate to the backend via a already existing web-app's Web
   **H** ooks (Slack, Discord, Gsuit, GitHub Actions, ECT.).  
3. An **A** plication Bridge program that can read the calls to the webhooks and
   pass them to the next component. 
4. A Backend **D** eamon that acutely presses the requests from the webhooks and
   updates a local copy of the site tree as needed.  
5. An application that regularly s **Y** ncs the local tree
   with the remote tree served as the static site in step 1.


What Is This?

In this webpage you will find the documentation for using the SHADY-STACK.

Before we dive into the stack, lets talk about the abstract concepts.

Is SHADY-STACK Right For You?
`````````````````````````````
There are some ups and downs to using this stack.

+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Pros                           | Cons                             |
+================================+==================================+
| Backend is hidden behind a     | Failure or delay in the web hook |
| proxy of sorts.                | provider means failure / delay   |
|                                | in your site.                    |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| It's free!                     | Depending on the web hook        |
|                                | provider, it may be breaking a   |
|                                | TOS or two                       |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| It's kinda fail-safe.          | The number of components between |
| If the backend breaks,         | your frontend and backend means  |
| the static parts of your       | it's slow to update.             |
| site will still work           |                                  |

Remember to consult your physician to see if SHADY-STACK is right for you.

Design Philosophy
````````````````

With the above in mind. The code for this project will follow these goals:

1. Secure defaults - It may be shady, but let's still not get pwnedâ€¦
2. Dead simple to set up - When using shady, time from project design to
   working product so be as fast as possible.
3. Minimize the amount of JS needed in a project - I hate writing it.

(These are mostly for me to keep in mind while developing).

What does SHADY-STACK Provide?
``````````````````````````````
You may be asking yourself, what tooling exists for this SHADY-STACK? Well,
while anyone is invited to build on these concepts, the SHADY-STACK repo_ 
provides the following:

- Bridge Applications For:
  - Discord
- A Default API Demon
- Default Hooks For Syncing Via Git

Each of these parts are explained in their respective sections.
