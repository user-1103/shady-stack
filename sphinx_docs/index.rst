Welcome to SHADY-STACK
======================

Overview
````````
Before we dive into the code, lets talk about the abstract concepts.

What Is SHADY-STACK?
-------------------

As the name implies, this is a less than kosher web stack based of the SWAG
stack. I developed it for my projects as I am in university and web hosting can
be expensive. The shady stack consists of the following:

1. A **S** tatic site hosted (GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, etc.) 
2. Simplistic pages that communicate to the backend via a already existing web-app's Web
   **H** ooks (Slack, Discord, Gsuit, GitHub Actions, etc.).  
3. An **A** plication Bridge program that can read the calls to the webhooks and
   pass them to the next component. 
4. A Backend **D** eamon that acutely presses the requests from the webhooks and
   updates a local copy of the site tree as needed.  
5. An application that regularly s **Y** ncs the local tree
   with the remote tree served as the static site in step 1.


What Is This?
-------------

In this webpage you will find the documentation for using the SHADY-STACK.

    This sample documentation was generated on |today|, and is rebuilt with

Is SHADY-STACK Right For You?
-----------------------------

There are some ups and downs to using this stack.

+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Pros                           | Cons                             |
+================================+==================================+
| Backend is hidden behind a     | Failure or delay in the webhook  |
| proxy of sorts.                | provider means failure/delay     |
|                                | in your site.                    |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| It's free!                     | Depending on the web hook        |
|                                | provider, it may be breaking a   |
|                                | TOS or two.                      |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| It's kinda fail-safe.          | The number of components between |
| If the backend breaks,         | your frontend and backend means  |
| the static parts of your       | it's slow to update.             |
| site will still work.          |                                  |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+

Remember to consult your physician to see if SHADY-STACK is right for you.

Design Philosophy
----------------

With the above in mind. The code for this project will follow these goals:

1. Secure defaults - It may be shady, but let's still not get pwnedâ€¦
2. Dead simple to set up - When using shady, time from project design to
   working product so be as fast as possible.
3. Minimize the amount of JS needed in a project - I hate writing it.

(These are mostly for me to keep in mind while developing.)

What does SHADY-STACK Provide?
------------------------------

You may be asking yourself, what tooling exists for this SHADY-STACK? Well,
while anyone is invited to build on these concepts, the SHADY-STACK repo_ 
provides the following:

- Bridge Applications For:

  - Discord

- A Default API Demon

- Default Hooks For Syncing Via Git

Each of these parts are explained in their respective sections.

Install
-------

The resources provided by the SHADY-STACK repo_ are in the form of a python
model of the name ``shadybackend``.

Currently the default demon and a specified bridge 
can be run as a nix_ flake with:

::

 nix run github:user-1103/shady-stack - <args>
 # To enter a development environment use:
 nix develop github:user-1103/shady-stack

For thoes of you who have yet to see the glory of nix_ the package can be
installed as a poetry_ project.

::

 # Clone the repo.
 git clone https://github.com/user-1103/shady-stack
 # Enter the repo:
 cd shady-stack
 # Install with poetry_
 poetry install
 # Run the backend components
 shadybackend <args>

If you have something against poetry_, you can install the dependencies your
self (found in pyproject.toml). And run:

::

 python3 top_level.py <args>

.. note::
   Need to set up a pip package...

Shady Backend
`````````````
The ``shadybackend`` python module is it the collection of resources provided
by the repo. The Install_ section outlines how to install and run the module
from the command line, subseqently allowing for acess to all the parts provided
by the repo. To progamiticly use the module, see 'Progmatic Use`_.

The Default API Demon (DAD)
```````````````````````````
DAD is an extremely bare bones Application Demon. When ``shadybackend`` is run,
it will be started. When run, DAD first looks for user defined APIs to load in
from ``api.py`` in the curent directory.

Defining APIs
-------------

An ``api.py`` file is a normal python file where you can define how your api.

Take the sample below:

..  code-block:: python
    :caption: api.py
    :linenos:

    from shadybackend.api_tools import define_api

    @define_api({"example_arg": "default_value", "required_arg_": 1})
    def example_api(G, ARGS):
        ... # Do some api stuff
