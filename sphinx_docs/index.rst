Overview
========

Before we dive into the code, lets talk about the abstract concepts.

What Is SHADY-STACK?
-------------------

As the name implies, this is a less than kosher web stack based of the SWAG
stack. I developed it for my projects as I am in university and web hosting can
be expensive. The shady stack consists of the following:

1. A **S** tatic site hosted (GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, etc.) 
2. Simplistic pages that communicate to the backend via a already existing web-app's Web
   **H** ooks (Slack, Discord, Gsuit, GitHub Actions, etc.).  
3. An **A** plication Bridge program that can read the calls to the webhooks and
   pass them to the next component. 
4. A Backend **D** eamon that acutely presses the requests from the webhooks and
   updates a local copy of the site tree as needed.  
5. An application that regularly s **Y** ncs the local tree
   with the remote tree served as the static site in step 1.

What Is This?
-------------

In this webpage you will find the documentation for using the SHADY-STACK.

.. note::

    This sample documentation was generated on |today|, and is rebuilt with
    each release.

Is SHADY-STACK Right For You?
-----------------------------

There are some ups and downs to using this stack.

+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Pros                           | Cons                             |
+================================+==================================+
| Backend is hidden behind a     | Failure or delay in the webhook  |
| proxy of sorts.                | provider means failure/delay     |
|                                | in your site.                    |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| It's free!                     | One must be carefull not to      |
|                                | violate any TOS when using       |
|                                | certian webhook providers.       |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| It's kinda fail-safe.          | The number of components between |
| If the backend breaks,         | your frontend and backend means  |
| the static parts of your       | it's slow to update.             |
| site will still work.          |                                  |
+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+

Remember to consult your physician to see if SHADY-STACK is right for you.

Design Philosophy
----------------

With the above in mind. The code for this project will follow these goals:

1. Secure defaults - It may be shady, but let's still not get pwnedâ€¦
2. Dead simple to set up - When using shady, time from project design to
   working product so be as fast as possible.
3. Minimize the amount of JS needed in a project - I hate writing it.

(These are mostly for me to keep in mind while developing.)

What does SHADY-STACK Provide?
------------------------------

You may be asking yourself, what tooling exists for this SHADY-STACK? Well,
while anyone is invited to build on these concepts, the SHADY-STACK repo_ 
provides the following:

- Bridge Applications For:

  - Discord

- A Default API Demon

- Default Hooks For Syncing Via Git

Each of these parts are explained in their respective sections.

Install
-------

The resources provided by the SHADY-STACK repo_ are in the form of a python
model of the name ``shadybackend``.

Currently, the default demon and a specified bridge 
can be run as a nix_ flake with:

::

 nix run github:user-1103/shady-stack - <args>
 # To enter a development environment use:
 nix develop github:user-1103/shady-stack

For those of you who have yet to see the glory of nix_ the package can be
installed as a poetry_ project.

::

 # Clone the repo.
 git clone https://github.com/user-1103/shady-stack
 # Enter the repo:
 cd shady-stack
 # Install with poetry_
 poetry install
 # Run the backend components
 shadybackend <args>

If you have something against poetry_, you can install the dependencies your
self (found in pyproject.toml). And run:

::

 python3 top_level.py <args>

.. note::
   Need to set up a pip package...

Shady Backend
=============

The ``shadybackend`` python module is it the collection of resources provided
by the repo. The Install_ section outlines how to install and run the module
from the command line, subsequently allowing for access to all the parts provided
by the repo. To progamaticly use the module, see `Pragmatic Use`_.

CLI Args
--------

No matter how you call shady, the following is roughly how it will be used.

::

 <command to call shady> '<name of bridge>' '<JSON describing the initial G value>'

See `default bridges`_ and `G`_ for more info.


Optional Args
-------------

Additionally, one may use the following:

-h, --help     show this help message and exit
-v, --verbose  Be chatty.
--tree TREE    Provide the location of the web root.
--api API      Provide the location of the api.py file.

The Default API Demon (DAD)
```````````````````````````

DAD is an extremely bare-bones Application Demon. When ``shadybackend`` is run,
it will be started. When run, DAD first looks for user defined APIs to load in
from ``api.py`` in the current directory.

Defining APIs
-------------

An ``api.py`` file is a normal python file where you can define how your API.

Take the sample below:

..  code-block:: python
    :caption: api.py

    from shadybackend.api_tools import define_api

    @define_api({"example_arg": "default_value", "required_arg_": 1})
    def example_api(G, ARGS):
        ... # Do some api stuff

Let's break down these lines one at a time:

1. Here we import the wrapper_ function for defining an API call.

2. A little space to breath.

3. We use the wrapper to define the `baseline arguments`_ for the API.

4. We declare a function that will do the actual backend processing of
   the API. The name of the API call is determined by the name of the function
   and is passed G_, and ARGS_.

Baseline Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

API baselines are one of the default security features of SHADY-STACK. The
baseline for an API exists as a dictionary keyed by strings representing the
name of the argument. The values represent the default values for the argument
if none is provided when the API is called. Before the API function is called,
the types of each supplied argument will be compared to the type of the default
value. If they do not match, the API will not be called. If the name of an
argument ends with a ``_``, it will be marked as required. If a required arg is
missing when an API call is requested, the API will not be called. All arguments
provided that are not found in the baseline will be silently dropped before
being called. Internal the default JSON_ lib is used and as such, only types
parsed by it can be used in the baseline.

G
~

When an API is called, it has access to a global dictionary named ``G`` a la flask_.
The data in this variable is shared across all API calls, hooks_, and Application Bridges.

.. note::
   A feature that is being considered is to save the state of ``G`` across runs of the backend.
   For now though, the state is purged on shutdown.

By default, DAD sets the following G_ variables:

+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Name            | Description                                      | 
+=================+==================================================+
| root            | The path to the location of the local web root.  |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| run             | Can be set to false to shutdown the demon.       |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Q               | The queue of Request objects to process.         |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| req             | The current request being processed. Useful for  |
|                 | error handling.                                 |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

`Default bridges`_ may define further values.

.. warning::
   It is probably best to not touch ``Q`` or ``req`` unless you know what you are doing.
   The Requests stored in these variables are not sanitized.

ARGS
~~~~
After the above parsing is done to the arguments provided to the webhook, they
are then provided to the API function via the ARGS_ variable.

HOOKS
-----

DAD provides a way to ensure certain actions happen when certain events happen
during the execution of DAD. Take the following addition to our ``api.py`` file:

..  code-block:: python
    :caption: api.py

    from shadybackend.api_tools import define_api, define_hook, HookTypes
    import time

    @define_api({"example_arg": "default_value", "required_arg_": 1})
    def example_api(G, ARGS):
        ... # Do some api stuff

    @define_hook(HookTypes.ERR)
    def log_error(G):
        with open("error.log", "a") as f:
            f.write(f"Failed to process request @{time.time()}\n")

This trivial example writes a log file every time DAD fails to process a
request. The available events you can hook are:

+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Name            |   Runs On...                                     |
+=================+==================================================+
| HookTypes.ERR   |   ...a failure in processing a request.          |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| HookTypes.INIT  |   ...demon startup.                              |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| HookTypes.PRE   |   ...the start of processing a request           |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| HookTypes.OK    |   ...the successful processing of a request      |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| HookTypes.POST  |   ...the end of the processing of a request      |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| HookTypes.EXIT  |   ...demon safe exit.                            |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| HookTypes.FATAL |   ...demon hitting an unliveable error.          |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| HookTypes.WAIT  |   ...demon idle.                                 |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

.. hint::
   You can use the ``OK`` hook to sync your local copy of the site to the
   remote static site.


Default Bridges
===============

The SHADY-STACK repo_ provides a bunch of default bridges that can be activated
with DAD.

Call Structure
--------------

When the user using the static front end of your site needs to do something
dynamic, the JS in the page should call the webhook watched by the Application
Bridge. In this call two things need to be passed the name of the API call to
use, and the arguments to pass to the API call. The bridges defined in the repo
expects the following data fields as a minimum:

+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Name            | Description                                      | 
+=================+==================================================+
| api_call        | The name of the api to use for the request.      |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| data            | A dictionary of args to pass to the request.     |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+

Discord Bridge
--------------

The discord bridge can be used by requesting the ``discord`` from DAD. First
though, you need to set up a `new discord server`_, a `webhook`_ for that server
(save this for latter), and then `register a new bot`_.

.. warning::
   As of the most recent discord API update, you will need to give your bot the
   `message content intent`_ for shady to work.

When you register a new bot, you will get a token that will allow the discord
bridge to act as your newly created bot. You will need to pass this token
through the G variable like so:

::

 python3 shadybackend "discord" '{"discord_token": "<bot token>"}'

This tells shady backend to start DAD with the discord bridge, and to connect
to the bot token provided. You can test your webhook with the following commands:

..  code-block:: sh
    :caption: test_hook.sh

    export WEBHOOK_URL="<your web hook url>"
    export SHADY_MSG='{"api_call":"example_api_call","data":{"example_arg":"foobar"}}'
    export WEBHOOK_MSG="{\"username\": \"test\", \"content\": \"$SHADY_MSG\"}"
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d $WEBHOOK_MSG $WEBHOOK_URL

.. note::
   Note how the shady `Call Structure`_ is wrapped by the discord call structure.

Hacking
=======

If you intend to modify the code provided in the repo_, the following should be helpful.

Pragmatic Use
-------------

The code is divided into a few logical modules, the first of which to consider
is ``top_level.py``:

.. automodule:: shadybackend.top_level
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :private-members:

The above code primaraly loads the requested bridge from ``bridges.py`` and starts DAD (located in ``demon.py``. These two modules are documented below:

.. automodule:: shadybackend.bridges
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :private-members:

.. automodule:: shadybackend.demon
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :private-members:

Finally, shady backend also provides two utility classes to deal with the two most common data types. The documentation for ``request_tools.py`` and ``api_tools.py`` follows:

.. automodule:: shadybackend.request_tools
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :private-members:

.. automodule:: shadybackend.api_tools
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :private-members:
